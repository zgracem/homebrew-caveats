# homebrew-caveats

This simple tap adds the command `brew caveats`, which prints all caveats
associated with installed formulae.

Inspired by @resistor4u's request in [Homebrew/brew#6643](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/6643).

## Installation

```sh
brew tap zgracem/caveats
```

## Usage

```sh
brew caveats
```
